## What is your strength - learner (v2)

Persuasiveness / Grit
Learner; quick / life-long
Frugal; I like optimizing processes / save money
Initiative

I consider myself a **learner** and it is never too old to learn.

When I joined numerix, our main tech stack was Java and JSF. But I never stop exploring differrent technologies by myself. Few year ago our team got an opportunity to work on a new project. According to my knowledage. I proposed to use Javascript, React instead of Java and JSF. I think we can achieve better performance and user experience with it.

We faced many challenges since begining of the project. React, Redux, and Webpack were a brand new development stack for us, and there were many new concepts to learn, such as SPA, unidirectional data flow, Redux state management, pure components, front-end package management etc.
It was very challenging but also rewardful. I learn a lot by reading documentation, watching video courses, and consult other team and friend who has experience.

The project was a great success. It not only helped our sales team win contracts. It also allow me to present the benefit using js, react and help our team build confident to transform from JSF to React.

## What are your weaknesses - introvert (v1)

[What are your weaknesses?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fz21zei0UE)

Introversion (pitch: ambivert)
Public speaking: most common and boring of all; speaking to small groups fine, large crowds of unknown people is a problem
Doesn’t ask for help / individualist
Honesty - sharing too much with others / Attempting to please everyone

%

I am more of an introvert, If I spend a lot of time with a large group of people, I tend to feel drained and need some alone time to recharge afterwards.

3 years ago I was scheduled to deliver demo and introduction of a new project in our yearly kick off meeting. I need to present the idea of the project in front of a 200+ crowd of people, mostly I'm unfamilar with; while I had previous experience in talking in front of an audience, it was for smaller audiences, and usually with people that I knew.

So I had started crafting my speech and asked my friends with previous experience about some tips and tricks about managing my emotions during my speech. Long story short, the speech went okay, it present our motivation and we recevided feedbacks also helped further development, however, it’s not by far the most comfortable thing I did, or something I specialize in my day to day my job.

## What are your weaknesses - individualist (optional) (v1)

%

I think I'm a individualist, I tend to work alone and feel asking for help is a sign of weakness or incompetence.

Early years in my career, there are many cases I tend to from a desire to prove myself as capable and independent which prevent me from seeking help from others.

After many years of experience and lessons. I think collaboration and seeking input from others can often lead to better results than working alone, especially when tackling complex problems or trying to meet tight deadlines.

Now I like to encourage our team especially junior developer to ask question when stuck. And I feel happy when they are able to ask good questions.

During one of my previous projects, I was approached by the QA team manager and was asked to help develop a modern UI for their internal tool, Template Studio. Given my interest and passion for frontend development, I jumped at the chance of working on this project without giving much thought to the requirements.

My team and I worked tirelessly to deliver a beautiful UI in the shortest time possible. Once we presented it to the QA team, they immediately began selling the product to a few clients who had expressed interest previously.

However, to our surprise, the clients were not interested in the product anymore. They had found a solution that met their needs, and Template Studio was not able to offer something unique or better. It was then that we realized that we failed to conduct proper market research to understand the needs of our potential users.

Learning from this experience, I stressed the importance of doing thorough market research before jumping into any project. We learned that the product's marketability is just as important as its quality.

When our team started to work on Numerix OneView (javascript react project). We have 4 developers in the team. And two of us have experience with react. So other two developers are assigned to work on lagecy project and doning support and maintenance work only. They both express their interest to learn react and wanted to work on the new project, but our manager seemed reluctant to change the assignment.

After discussing the matter with my manager, I understood that his main concern was completing the project on time. He felt that the two developers can catch up later after the release, without affecting the deadline. However, I thought that as the project progressed, it would become more and more complex, making it harder for them to catch up, requiring even more of my time to help them.

To address this issue, I created a detailed plan, including the amount of time we needed to spend each day and the skills they had to learn before contributing to the project. We guaranteed that this would not affect our productivity.

Our manager agreed to my plan, and although I had to spend an extra one to two hours initially to help them, I was happy that they were able to catch up and start contributing to the project. As a team, we successfully completed the project.

## Tell me about a time you had to convince others to follow your recommendation/plan/suggestion

I have previously worked on building a project named NumerixESG.

Instead of sticking with JSF, which is currently used in our team, I conducted extensive research on Angular and React. After trying them out on my own and consulting with friends who have experience with both, I concluded that React is a great fit for this project.

I proposed my idea to the team and our manager and explained why I thought React was the way to go. I listed several major challenges that our current JSF project was facing and how React could help us solve those challenges, such as:

  1. The build process is very slow, it takes around 5 minutes to build and deploy the project in dev enviroment.  To make things worse, the hot reload is constantly broken, we have to restart the server if it doesn't work.
  2. The performance is not idea even after we optimize the code.
  3. JSF UI library we used (Primefaces) is not very popular framework, it is hard to find resources online.

And React also brings more benefits such as:

  1. light weight framework and very flexible
  2. over all faster ui experience
  3. trending front-end technology, great documentation and community support

Using React, I was able to build a prototype in a few weeks. The finished project was well received by both our team and the sales team due to the great user experience and easier set-up process. The success of our PoC project convinced our team to switch to React for future projects.

## When you are new to a situation or environment. How did you adapt that?

1-2 (v3)

Our IAS team was facing a critical issue with our product download page. The current download page was built on Salesforce Aura. The design was obsolete, and the support team had to modify the source code manually, which made the update process excruciatingly slow and sometimes caused the browser to crash. Additionally, the outdated design stored all binary files within Salesforce, which was quite expensive compared to popular cloud storage options like AWS S3. (charging an additional $125/month for 500MB)

As someone who had never worked on the Salesforce platform before, I spent about a month educating myself by studying Salesforce trailheads, attending Salesforce conferences, and discussing with the rest of the IAS team. We evaluated three options to resolve the issue.

1. Refactor based on current code, this is the easiest way, but since it is base on outdated technology, the performance won't be any better.
2. Use third party solution, it is the most expensive way and overkill for our needs.
3. Rebuild the page use Salesforce DX toolkits, LWC and migrate all binary to AWS S3.

I strongly advocated for the third option over the other two. Although it required more time and effort, it proved to be the most cost-effective and future-proof solution, which we ultimately implemented.

The results turned out to be better than expected. The new version is much faster and more stable than the old one. It is capable of automatically generating download links after releases and retains the ability to manually configure the page if needed. It has also saved a significant amount of time for the support team.
After completing the download page, we worked closely with the support team and migrated all the files to AWS S3, which saved us at least $8,000 per month.

4-1 (v2)

For the past few years, I have worked on various tasks, including the highly significant project called Numerix OneView, where I was the senior developer involved in the development from start to finish. I take complete responsibility for the project's success.

From a business/non-tech perspective, I worked closely with our FE and sales teams to understand requirements, define achievable goals, and establish timelines. We maintained regular communication throughout the project's duration.

Regarding development, we took a proactive approach to identify and mitigate risks. We noticed that an inconsistent project structure and code standard were harmful to our productivity and the project quality as it grew.

- We used standardized scaffolding. Start from same scaffold reduced a lot of time to set up a new project by save time consuming bioplate config and avoid common mistake. It also redued the learning curve for new hires.

- In the scaffold we included eslint, prettier ensure standard code format and results in less bugs and better overall code quality.

- Lastly, we also use Bitbucket pipeline to set up ci/cd to streamline the development process.

I worked on a task to collaborate with the IAS team and rebuild our support portal. However, the IAS team was used to working with a traditional approach to project management and was hesitant to use a new tool that I had proposed.

First, I scheduled a meeting with the team and presented the new tool, highlighting the benefits it would bring to the team's workflow. I explained that the new tool would streamline our workflow and make the development process more organized and efficient. However, the team was still not convinced since they were used to the old way, which worked for them, and were wary of the learning curve involved.

After addressing their concerns, mostly about the learning curve, I offered to create a training plan containing very detailed step-by-step instructions, as well as a list of tutorial videos to help them get started in a few days.

Finally, I asked for their feedback and made adjustments and improvements to the training materials to ensure that new hires can get up to speed quickly.

After adopting the new toolkit, the IAS team noticed the positive effects of the tool for project management and started appreciating its benefits.

## Describe a situation in which you met a major obstacle in order to complete a project. How did you deal with it? What steps did you take?

1-3 (v4)

I have previously worked on a project called NumerixESG (Economic Scenario Generator), and we encountered an obstacle when our sales team requested the project to be finished four weeks before the original deadline.

To meet this new deadline, we had to find a way to prioritize our work effectively while ensuring that we met the project requirements and quality standards. Here are the steps I took to ensure that we caught up with the deadline and completed all the necessary features:

1. We gathered time estimates for all remaining tasks. This gave us a better understanding of the overall time required by the project at its current stage.

2. We worked together with the sales team and used the lean prioritization technique, where we assigned a priority level to each task based on the effort, time estimate, and potential impact. For example, we set lower priority to many non-essential visual elements(animation, charts, themes) and postpone to next release if necessary.

3. We used a mock data service instead of waiting for the backend team to provide the REST API. This helped us save a lot of time during integration and acted as a backup in case the backend service could not be finished on time.

4. We also communicated with stakeholders from other projects and requested delay some of the tasks that were not urgent.

By implementing these measures, we were able to successfully complete the feature development within the given timeline. We were able to launch the product without any major bugs and it was well-received by our client.

## What is the hardest technical problem you have faced on projects so far and how did you solve it? What was the result?

1-0 (v2)

For the past few years we have worked on numerix oneview. For our team, the most challenging part of the project is maintaining its performance as it gets more complex.

The project uses a variety of technologies, including Javascript, TypeScript, React, and Redux. To prevent performance issues from happening, we use a few techniques.

There are three main parts:

- identify the bottleneck
  - chrome/react dev tools, to measure the rendering time of each component
- performance optimization
  - reduce unnecessary render
  - push content down
  - pull content up (example: use 'children' prop)
  - memoization: use with caution, it has extra cost and add up
  - lazy loading: suspense api
  - urgent first: transaction api
  - [React Performance](../../../Tech%20Stack/React%20Performance/performance.md)
- tracking/monitoring
  - front-end monitoring system
  - details of the system
    - what to track
    - how to track
    - how to analyze
    - how to report

Despite the challenges we face, we're proud of the efforts we've put in to ensure that the project maintains good performance and user experience.

6-2 (v1)

One project I am particularly passionate about was building Numerix OneView. I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of React, which I had gained through learning.

Throughout the project, I worked closely with the sales and frontend teams to optimize each feature for the best user experience. I leveraged React for its component-based architecture and Redux for state management. This combination helped me to maintain a clear separation of concerns and scale the application as needed.

Furthermore, I utilized Typescript to enhance the application's type safety and reduce potential errors. The added benefit of type checking made the code stronger, and it had great maintainability.

Overall, I am proud of the work I did on this project, as it showcased my ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to build complex, maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

## How do you handle work life balance

%

6-3 (v1)

Maintaining a good work-life balance is important to me as it allows me to recharge and perform better at work. There are several strategies that I employ to maintain this balance:

- Prioritizing - I prioritize my workload and focus on the most important tasks first, set achievable workload for every day work so I can complete within normal working hours and have time for other activities.

- Focus hour - I have highest energy level in the morning, so I do complex tasks in the morning and leave relatively easy tasks for later.

- Regular physical activity - I find regular physical activity, such as exercise improving my overall well-being help recharge myself.

- Hobbies - I also leave time for hobbies during weekend and socializing with friends and family.
